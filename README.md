Getting Started
Welcome to the Eclipse Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Eclipse IDE.

Folder Structure
The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

1.Src: Here you will find the mini zelda game files made in eclipse
2.Res: Images used in projects to develop sprites, whether of the player or enemies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the bin folder by default.

MiniZelda in Java: It is a study project that is subject to changes in the future or a new version of any kind, made as 
a learning experience for initial concepts about programming in games.
Feel free to suggest criticisms, ideas, ways to improve and so on. Thank you and keep studying and programming. 
Thank's for your time!
